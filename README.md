SingleGeneControlled
====================

Single gene dynamics under controlled mating simulation

The simulator stochastically models the temporal evolution of a biallelic polymporhpism in a fixed size deme under conditions of controlled mating. The model is based on jump diffusion processes and uses Monte-Carlo simulation to demonstrate the behaviour of an isolated deme whose size is bounded above can be subject to partial extinction.
